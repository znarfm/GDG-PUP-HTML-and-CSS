# HTML #3 Assignment: Clickable Image Link

## Overview

This assignment will guide you in creating a clickable image link using Markdown. You will learn how to insert an image related to your hobby and make it clickable, linking to an external website with more information.

## Instructions

1. **Open Your Code Editor**:
   - Use a code editor like Visual Studio Code.

2. **Create a New File**:
   - Create a new file and save it as `README.md`.

3. **Write the Markdown for a Clickable Image Link**:
   - Copy and paste the following Markdown code into `README.md`:

     ```markdown
     [![My Hobby](https://example.com/hobby-image.jpg)](https://example.com/more-info)
     ```

4. **Explanation**:
   - `[![Alt Text](image_url)](target_link)`: The syntax for creating a clickable image link in Markdown.
   - `Alt Text`: Describes the image for accessibility purposes.
   - `image_url`: The path or URL of the image you want to display.
   - `target_link`: The URL that the user will be directed to when they click on the image.
   - The above example displays an image with the alt text "My Hobby" and links to `https://example.com/more-info` when clicked.

5. **Save Your File**:
   - Save `README.md` to ensure your code is saved properly.

6. **Preview the Markdown File**:
   - Open the Markdown preview in your editor (in VSCode, use `Ctrl+Shift+V` or right-click the file and select "Open Preview").
   - Verify that the image displays correctly and is clickable, redirecting you to the specified website.

## Tips

- Make sure the image URL is correct and accessible (you can use an image hosted online or save a local image in your project folder).
- Use descriptive alt text for better accessibility and SEO.
- Ensure your file is saved with the `.md` extension.
