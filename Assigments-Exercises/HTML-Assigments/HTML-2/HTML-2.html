    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Meinard Francisco, a student of BSCS 3-5. I am currently 21 years old, and I am from Antipolo, Philippines. I hope to learn more about web development in the future. 
    </p>

    <h2>Things I do</h2>
    <p>I am currently learning about the basics of Web Development. I mainly code in Python, as it is very easy to learn and understand. During my free time, I like to just watch YouTube videos and learn new things. I even try to contribute to interesting repos that I find on GitHub.</p>
